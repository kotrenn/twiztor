Define a Twiztor $T = (X, P)$ to be a pair of a set of points $X$ and a set of permutation generators $P\subseteq S_X$, where $S_X$ denotes the symmetric group on $X$.

\section{Coxeter Groups}

A group is a \emph{Coxeter group} if it is generated by a set of involutions.

Some examples of Coxeter Twiztors include AAA, AFD, and AFG.

\section{Cayley Graphs}

Given a group $G$ and a set of generators $S$ for G, the \emph{Cayley Graph} $C(G, S)$ is the graph with vertices the elements of $G$ and an edge from $g$ to $h$ if and only if $h = gs$ for some $s\in S$.

For Twiztors, the Cayley graph is not necessarily the same as the Twiztor graph.

The puzzle ACG is based on the Cayley graph of $S_4$ with generators $S = \{(1 2 3), (1 4)\}$.
